Take 15 images

Downsample using various filters (or none)
-catrom (cubic)
-None (no interpolation)
-Linear * MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT BLURRING
-Triangle / Bilinear (may be same)
-lanczos
The script didnt like bilinear and linear


Write a script that takes the 15 images and use them on the train_image.py

Change the code so that way we can choose a random downsampling while training. This may lead to a better NN that is more robust.
